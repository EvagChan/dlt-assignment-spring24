# Distributed Ledger Techologies Assignment
## Spring 2024
Cource: Distributed Ledger Techologies
Assignment Grade: 10/10

### Description 

The scope of the assignment was to create a script that simulates a blockchain with three functions:

- Mining: Finds a nonce for a new block by repeatedly hashing the block's header until it meets a difficulty target. It returns the nonce and the mining time.
- Merkle Tree Construction: Builds a Merkle tree from a list of transactions, returning the tree's levels.
- Proof of Transaction: Generates a proof of the existence of a transaction in the Merkle tree, returning the sibling hashes needed for verification.

It then demonstrates these functions by mining a block, constructing the Merkle tree, and generating a proof for a transaction.
